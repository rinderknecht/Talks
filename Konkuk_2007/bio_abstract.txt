Biography

Christian Rinderknecht, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor at the
department of Internet and Multimedia in the College of
Telecommunications of Konkuk University (Seoul).

His main research interests are (1) the application of formal methods
to software engineering, (2) XML technologies as found in document
processing and databases and (3) data engineering to enable the
interoperability of heterogeneous distributed systems.

The Ariadne thread is a focus on designing and making useful tools to
support the engineer or the end-user, with a keen eye on formal
modeling in order to ensure reliability.


Abstract

The topic presented today is work in progress, a collaboration with
Dr. Nic Volanschi, who initiated the research and implemented a
prototype. (See http://mygcc.free.fr/)

Programme checking technology is now mature but not used on a large
scale by developers. One of the reasons is the decoupling of checking
tools from the development tools, in particular the compiler. We
explore the integration of simple user-defined checks into the
compiler, a technique known as _meta-compilation_. Usually, the checks
are specified as a list of programme patterns expressed in the source
language, but this approach is technically difficult to implement
because the patterns are parsed before being matched against the
programme. Instead, we propose a lighter and language-independent
alternative that we call _unparsed patterns_.
